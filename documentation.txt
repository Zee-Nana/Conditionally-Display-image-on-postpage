## Usage
### Setting the Display of Featured Images
1. Create or edit a post or page in your WordPress admin dashboard.
2. On the post or page edit screen, you'll find a "Conditional Featured Image" meta box in the sidebar.
3. Inside the meta box, there will be a checkbox labeled "Display featured image on single view."
4. Check the checkbox if you want the featured image to be shown on the single view of the post or page.
5. Uncheck the checkbox if you want to hide the featured image on the single view.
6. Save or update the post or page to apply the changes.

### Modifying the Featured Image Display
The "Conditional Featured Image" plugin alters the display of featured images on single views based on your settings. By default, WordPress displays the featured image on single post or page views. However, with this plugin, you have the ability to override that behavior for each post or page.

The plugin provides a filter that controls the display of featured images on single views. By default, the filter is applied to the `post_thumbnail_html` filter hook. If the "Display featured image on single view" checkbox is checked for a specific post or page, the featured image will be displayed. If the checkbox is unchecked, the featured image will be hidden.

You can customize the plugin code to modify the behavior or apply the filter to a different hook if needed.
